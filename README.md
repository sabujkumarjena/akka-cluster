# Hands-on Course on akka-cluster
This is an exploratory hands-on course on *akka-cluster* . Most of the code snippet and documentation and diagrams are 
taken from official [akka-documentation](http://akka.io)

### How to install
- either clone the repo or download as zip
- open with IntelliJ as an SBT project
- add *myapp-dev.log* file to project directory to append logs

No need to do anything else, as the IDE will take care to download and apply the appropriate library dependencies.
